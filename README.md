# mozaik-ext-githubcontributions

This is a [Mozaik](https://mozaik.rocks) extension to show number of GitHub contributions by a set of people

It uses the [GitHub GraphQL v4 API](https://developer.github.com/v4/) and gets the number of commits by each person and then adds them up!

You can check the [demo here](https://mozaik-githubcontributions.herokuapp.com/) and the [demo's repo is here](https://github.com/karuppiah7890/mozaik-ext-githubcontributions-demo/)
